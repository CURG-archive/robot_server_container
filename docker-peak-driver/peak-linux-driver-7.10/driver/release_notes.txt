2011-07-28 - 7.3 - content:

  while options are set in the kernel! So this delivery is quite the same than
  2011-07-27 but enforces some kernel config check and removes a patch of a
  customer that brought some warning on 64-bits compilation.

- handle new PCAN-miniPCI-Express
- fix potential issue in PCIeC driver by using a delayed work instead of a timer
  to control the leds (i2c_transfer() may sleep because of underlying drivers).
- fix some crashes when PCIeC support was requested
- fix driver build until v3.03
- fix potential infinite loop in usb driver part
- fix wrong /dev/NULL ref in driver Makefile 
- make install now adds peak_xxx mainline drivers to system blacklist (see 
  udev/blacklist-peak.conf) and forces their unloading from memory
- fix potential issue with PCAN-USB fw 2.8
- add "uninstall" target to Makefiles to properly remove driver from the system

- dev_register(pcan_main_linux.c): add forgotten HW_ISA_SJA type when creating
  and removing nodes with UDEV_SUPPORT
- pcan_usb_setCANOff(pcan_usb.c): always force usb_clear_halt() and mdelay(50)
  after CAN=off: this fixes an issue writing a single msg then closing the 
  device next.
- transmittest.cpp: fix wrong errno usage calling CAN_Write
- receivetest.c: fix wrong errno usage calling LINUX_CAN_Read

2013-04-04 - 7.8.1 - content:
- src/sja1000.c: remove useless test on RECEIVE_MSG_COUNTER

2013-04-15 - 7.8.2 - content:
- add mutex to control access to devices list; add two functions to safe

  or at least, to access devices list with respect to  mutual exclusion.

- src/pcan_main.c: rework remove_dev_list() to remove device EVEN if no
  cleanup() callback is regigistered (potential memory cosumption)

  deprecated since 3.9)

2013-08-07 - 7.9-beta
- src/pcan_usb.c: handle the fact that DLC field in PCAN-USB protocol can 
  be > 8. For the moment, 'dlc' fields in user C structs is not!

2013-08-13 - 7.9-local
- fix bug in first column of /proc/pcan when displaying USB device can channel
- also moved to more efficient way of filling and returning struct objects in
